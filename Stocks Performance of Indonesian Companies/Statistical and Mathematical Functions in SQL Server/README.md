## Statistical and Mathematical Functions in SQL Server

In this folder, I present and demonstrate how to utilize statistical and mathematical functions within MS SQL Server environment to answer
various data-related questions. When it comes to mathematical functions, several functions I employed in this folder are LOG10() and LOG()
in order to return 10-based and natural logarithms, respectively.
I will also utilize statistical functions to answer business-related question, including calculating moving standard deviation and anything
else that are coming in this folder.
