## Database Design with Star Schema in PostgreSQL

This folder objective is to demonstrate how to design a database with star schema. In summary, database schema constitute one main table that contains measures of our data or also known as
fact table and it is surrounded by several tables that encompass various dimension attribute called as dimension tables. Both fact and dimension tables are connected through a single column
in which contains unique identification number or code (such as ID or combination of text and number as well). 

Recall from my cashless payments system project, I enclose all steps within this folder in designing the new database named "cashless_system_star" within PostgreSQL engine.

This is the result of database star schema in dark theme. The database schema is also available in light theme, please see the above .jpg file.
