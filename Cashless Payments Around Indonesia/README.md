## Cashless Payments System in Indonesia
This project examines cashless payments system around Indonesia and answers several data-related questions. Specifically, I utilize time series dataset of recognized cashless payment systems in Indonesia, namely debit cards, credit cards, Bank Indonesia National Clearing System (in Indonesia officially called as Sistem Kliring Nasional Bank Indonesia), and Bank Indonesia Real-Time Gross Settlement System, ranging from January 2020 to December 2022 for 34 Provinces.


Furthermore, this project also explores the utilization of Structured Query Language (SQL) syntaxes to answer any business questions related to the data. There are two main softwares that will be employed within this project, namely PostgreSQL for SQL database and Tableau Desktop to visualize our data. Nevertheless, this folder will only examine the utilization of PostgreSQL. Please kindly check my Tableau Public account for the results of Data Visualization (Tableau Dashboard is forthcoming).

This repository will present the fundamentals of PostgreSQL Queries and answer all relevant business-related questions, including:
+ SELECT Statements
+ JOINs and UNIONs
+ CASE Statement
+ Subqueries
+ Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
+ Window Function
+ Statistical Functions in PostgreSQL
+ Time Series Analysis Using PostgreSQL
